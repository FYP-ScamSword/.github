### Overview

ScamSword is a final-year project that was developed over the course of 15 weeks. We collaborated with [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/) to come up with prototype services to validate the effectiveness and preempt potential challenges involving offensive scam-prevention measures. Broadly, our project aims to address achieve 2 main goals:

1. Proactively identifying malicious sites through the inspection of URLs, page content, images, and thereafter sending out takedown requests to the relevant DNS and hosting providers

2. Diverting the attention and resources of scammers who interact through anonymized online chats and dummy accounts
