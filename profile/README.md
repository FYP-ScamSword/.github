### Overview

ScamSword is a final-year project that was developed over the course of 15 weeks. We collaborated with [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/) to come up with prototype services to validate the effectiveness and pre-empt potential challenges pertaining to the implementation of offensive scam-prevention measures. Broadly, our project aims to achieve 2 main goals:

1. Proactively identifying malicious sites through the inspection of URLs, page content, images, and thereafter sending out takedown requests to the relevant DNS and hosting providers.

2. Diverting the attention and resources of scammers through a web app that facilitates anonymous online chats using dummy accounts, allowing users to assume the role of various fake personas.

A high-level overview of the project is accessible through our [project poster](./ScamSword-Poster.pdf)
